# EngineTweaks_for_MakingHistory
This mod adjusts the specs on Making History engines and 3 stock engines to balance them and ensure every engine has a unique niche. The changes are balanced against other engines. If the thrust is changed, weight is also adjusted accordingly.

WARNING: This mod removes the Poodle from the game which could have a serious impact on existing games.
